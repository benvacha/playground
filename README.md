### Keep Calm Procrastinate On
No API? No RSS? No problem! *KCPO* makes use of open APIs, open RSS feeds, HTML scraping, or whatever methodologies are available to gather, standardize, and display content from multiple (or one, lol) time wasting sources.

## History

#### KCCO v1.0.0
In a long time forgotten, [The Chive](http://thechive.com) had no mobile app and was not mobile friendly. The only solution was to build a web application to scrape The Chive and render a responsive mobile friendly GUI. The *KCCO* app made use of PHP, XHTML, CSS, and JS to deliver a usable interface. The *KCCO* app lives on only as a [branch](https://github.com/benvacha/kcpo/tree/kcco) of the *KCPO* project.

#### KCPO v1.0.0
The Chive released a new design for their website and broke the scraping algorithm used in the *KCCO* app. Instead of simply updating the algorithm it was time to move into the future. The *KCPO* project was born. Version 1.0.0 of the *KCPO* project used NodeJS, Express, XHTML, CSS, and JS to clone the *KCCO* application.

#### KCPO v2.X.X
The vision for the *KCPO* project has always been to deliver content from many sources into a single interface. Version 1.0.0 makes use of NodeJS, Express, and Angular to realize this vision.

#### KCPO vX.X.X
Gallery archives, gallery categories, endless galleries, tags, favorites, composite galleries, and much more.
